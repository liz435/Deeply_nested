Random
The unpredictability and randomness are only limited by perspectives. 
A butterfly event can be seen as a random event, but in fact it is just a chaotic system 
that people don't have enough data to calculate the event. Nothing is truly random. 
The random generated by computers are pseudorandom, meaning they are "fake random", 
and they are generated by a algorithm that can be reverse interpreted. 

Random defination: Having no specific pattern, purpose, or objective: synonym: chance.
When roll a dice, the result might seem random, but the result was determined by many different factors, 
like how high throw it, how much force did you apply to it, the surface where dice landed etc.

perspectives determine random
