Random
The unpredictability and randomness are only limited by perspectives. A butterfly event can be seen as a random event, but in fact it is just a chaotic system that people don't have enough data to calculate the event. Nothing is truly random. The random generated by computers are pseudorandom, meaning they are "fake random", and they are generated by a algorithm that can be reverse interpreted.
